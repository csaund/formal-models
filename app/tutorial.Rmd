## R Coding Exercises

### Exercise 

*Here's a few exercises to get you started coding up a linear regression.*

The first thing to do with any data set is plot it to get a feel for how the 
data is distributed. 

Write R Code to create a scatter plot with a smoothed line of speed vs. distance in the `cars` dataset:

```{r scatter-plot, exercise=TRUE}
scatter.smooth(...)
```

```{r scatter-plot-hint}
# the main relationship we're going to examine is "Dist ~ Speed"
x=cars$speed
y=cars$dist
scatter.smooth(x, y, main=...)
```



## Multiple Choice Questions

### Quiz

Some questions you should answer to verify you understand the motivation and mechanisms behind linear regression.

```{r quiz math}
x <- 42
quiz(
  question("When is regression analysis *inappropriate*?",
    answer("you have two variables that are measured on an interval or ratio scale"),
    answer("you are trying to predict one variable from another"),
    answer("when plotted, your data forms a reasonably straight line"),
    answer("when plotted, your data is heteroscedastic", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  question("A regression line...",
    answer("passes through as many points as possible", correct = TRUE),
    answer("minimizes squared distance from the points", correct = TRUE),
    answer("goes through the average of each data point at a particular x value"),
    answer("is used to classify new data")
  ),
  question("As the correlation coefficient (r) gets larger, our prediction for Y (the dependent variable)...",
    answer("gets smaller"),
    answer("does not change"),
    answer("gets closer to the mean of Y"),
    answer("gets closer to the mean of X", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  # this should be a proper question where we give a regression equation and ask them to 
  # predict Y
  question("Which equation correctly describes the regression line for Y in relation to X?",
    answer(sprintf("$\\sqrt{x} = %d$", x + 1)),
    answer(sprintf("$x ^ 2 = %d$", x^2))
  ),
  question("What does 'MSE' mean?...",
    answer("placeholder"),
    answer("placeholder2", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```

```{r quiz-2}
quiz(
  question("What do you think this is a picture of?",
    answer("god only knows", correct=TRUE),
    answer("why would you choose a random image from your downloads for this?")
  )
)
